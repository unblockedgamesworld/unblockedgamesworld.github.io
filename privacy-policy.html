            <h3>9. Children Users</h3>
            <p>
                We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Slope Game Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the Slope Game General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game. When presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age. Based on your age information and your device settings, Slope Game does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement. The Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Slope Game General Site, and the Slope Game Kids Site supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA"). The Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Slope Game General Site and the Slope Game Kids site will not request any personal information from Children Users. There is no registration required for the Slope Game Kids Site and any advertising shown on the Slope Game Kids Site, or in the the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Slope Game General Site, is age-appropriate. The Slope Game Kids Site and the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Slope Game General Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose. The Slope Game Kids Site and the the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Slope Game General Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, including cookies, from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us: Identify whether you are a child or adult for data protection purposes to determine the legal requirements for our processing of your data Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Slope Game Kids Site Perform network communications Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Slope Game Kids Site Serve contextual advertising on the Slope Game Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising We have separated our platform into a few sections. Slope Game Kids was created for our youngest audience and is fully COPPA compliant.

On Slope Game.com, you’ll find games that are intended at users that are over 13.

We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim. Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it. Data Portability: You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data. Right to Object: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing. If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
